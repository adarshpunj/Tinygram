# Tinygram
Instagram compressed in 4000 bytes of HTML document
[Demo](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/adarshpunj/Tinygram/blob/master/tinygram.html)

> This was inspired by the [St4kflow project](http://danlec.com/blog/stackoverflow-in-4096-bytes)

## Features
The features are limited to visiting profiles, exploring hashtags pages, etc. Photos available on a page can be zoomed in.

## Size
The total size of the document is 4066 bytes including CSS and JavaScript. 
I have rebuilt the Instagram logo (SVG) to reduce the file size. The total size of this logo is only 234 bytes (one rectangle, and two circles).
